# Introduction
This repository contains the code for **Quantitative susceptibility mapping in the brain with phase-cycled bSSFP at 7T**. The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of QSM with bSSFP, including the simultaneous mapping of T₁, T₂, and proton density (PD), and to address limitations of off-resonance frequency mapping in multi-compartment scenarios.

# Functionality

There are two self-contained functions with self explanatory names. One is for multiparametric estimation (T1, T2, proton density) and qualitative elliptical parameter mapping (NLLS_Mapping); and the other one is to estimate off-resonance (OffResonance_Mapping).
Due to ongoing patenting progress, asymmetry mapping and asymmetry-induced phase estimation is not included yet.
